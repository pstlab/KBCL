			RDF statements describe the characteristics of their subjects using 
			properties (predicates in RDF terminology).
			
			The first property says "the subject has property with name feature:size
			which has the literal value 12".
			
			The second property says "the subject has property with name feature:color
			with object referring to the statement with ID http://linkeddatatools.com/colors#white"
			
			Note that the second predicate is referring to a subject ID of another 
			statement (a resource). Objects in RDF can refer (reference) the subjects
			of other statements.
