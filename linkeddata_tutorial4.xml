		OWL Ontology Header
		
		Although an ontology doesn't have to include header, it is a good
		practice to include information that can help others to understand
		what your ontology contains.
		In this example we include a title and a description for the ontology.
		But this is also the place where we could include version information
		and where you can state that your ontology imports other ontologies.

		IMPORTANT POINT 
		At this point, if you are an object oriented programmer, your mind may well 
		be thinking of programmatic object classes and their associated properties and 
		comparing them to what we've just learned out OWL classes. Don't - they're not quite 
		the same. Note from the example above. The 'family' property was defined independent 
		of any class type, and was assigned to the instance of class flower (magnolia). 
		Another instance of the same class may not have this property. So in OWL, note that 
		the properties that instances have are not described in their class types, but their 
		instances. In this case, you may use the same 'family' property for an instance of a 
		completely different class.
